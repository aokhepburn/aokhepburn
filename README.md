### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ 

#### I'm Alice Hepburn and I'm a junior developer and recent Flatiron School graduate. Welcome to my page! ðŸŒŠ

I have a background in fine arts and a passion for sailing and oceanography that is reflected in my projects. Currently literate in Python, JavaScript, and Swift I am continuously trying to learn new technologies to bring applications to users in the right format.
